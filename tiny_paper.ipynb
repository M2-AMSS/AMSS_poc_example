    "## Triangular representation of a 3-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "STL file format is perhaps  the main standard for 3D printing. The format is specified as both an ASCII (printable character) format as well as a binary format. This format provides a **triangular representation of a 3-dimensional surface geometry**. The surface is broken down into a series of small triangles call facets. Each facet is identified by a normal unit vector (perpendicular to the facet and with a length of 1.0) and by three vertices (corners of the triangle). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Orientation of a facet is determined by the direction of the unit normal and the order in which the vertices are listed (see next fig., left side). This two ways to specify facet orientation are redundant and must be consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each facet (triangle) must share two vertices (corners) with each of its neighboring \n",
    "  facets. Next figure (right side) shows a violation of this rule and a correct configuration.\n",
